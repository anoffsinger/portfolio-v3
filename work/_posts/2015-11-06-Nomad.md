overview:
    - As a frequent traveler, I always struggle to remember the details of the hidden gems I find on my trips.
    - If you asked me today where I found the best vegetarian food in Ahmedabad or which hidden beach in Nicaragua was the most serene, I wouldn’t be able to tell you a name or location, though my memories of the experiences are vivid.
    - It’s these adventures and the ability to share them with those you love that make travel worth it.
    - Nomad is an ongoing personal project that aims to solve this problem by giving you a simple central place to catalogue the places you visit and share them with friends seeking similar adventures. It makes saving, sending, and receiving trip itineraries and locations easy.
outcome:
    - No outcome yet, as this is an ongoing project. ☺️
    - However, in the process of pursuing this project I’ve opened the door to the world of Swift and iOS development, so in that sense it’s already a great success.
tools:
    - Sketch, Swift
