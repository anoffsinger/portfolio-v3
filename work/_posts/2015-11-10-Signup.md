overview:
    - As part of the app redesign, I owned global signup and login.
    - From the outset, we knew that our existing funnels were struggling to support the different needs of new markets as we rapidly expanded around the world. We identified that we needed to create a modular platform that would enable customizable funnels by market.
    - I proposed that we break down our previously cluttered onboarding steps into simple, bite-sized screens that could be easily re-arranged, would decrease the cognitive load placed on users, and would enable easier experimentation.
    - We validated our hypothesis that the new flow would be easier for users early on by testing a rough Framer prototype on the ground in India and China to great results.
    - We then went on to further smooth the funnel by designing visually consistent layouts, buttery animations, and intelligently routing users to login or signup based on phone number.
outcome:
    - While I canâ€™t share exact numbers, there has been a sustained double-digit increase in funnel conversion since we launched the new app. It was a great success.
    - Multiple teams at Uber have effortlessly plugged into the platform to create localized onboarding experiences, fraud fighting measures, and new payment systems.

    - Sketch, Framer, After Effects

![Main signup and login flow](../images/signup/signup-flow-1.png){: .post-image-large}

Flow showing signup, login from phone, and login from email.

In our flows, we had to account for signing up with a new number, signing up with a pre-existing number (that someone else used to own), login from phone number, and login from email (if the user just got a new phone number).

It sounds complicated, because it was. There were a number of tricky edge cases that required iterations on both designs and server-side logic â€” full credit to the awesome engineers working with me on this project ðŸ˜‰

In all, the system contains around 30 screens created from a base system of 8 layouts.

Flows in individual markets vary in both length and content depending on legal obligations and the information that makes sense to require for signup â€” for example, email isnâ€™t widely used in some developing countries.

All screens were also versioned in multiple languages.

Prototyping was a constant factor throughout the design process, both for feeling out/iterating upon our flows and for fine tuning the micr-interactions that made the experience feel fluid and magical.
{: .paragraph-dark .post-paragraph-embedded}

The animation of our black, circular next button was meant to mirror the behavior our circular shortcuts userâ€™s would later encounter on the home screen, which conveyed the concept of forward momentum through right-to-left motion.
