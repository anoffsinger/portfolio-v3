title: Rider Signup

overview:
    - As part of the app redesign, I owned global onboarding.
    - Our existing experience couldn’t support Uber’s rapid expansion in global markets, so we set out to create a modular platform that could enable customized funnels by market.
    - We broke down what were previously cluttered onboarding screens into simple, bite-sized steps that aimed at decreasing cognitive load and enabling easier experimentation.
outcome:
    - Since launch, there’s been 10% increase in funnel conversion.
    - While some of this work is still being rolled out, 5+ teams at Uber have already plugged into the new platform. They’ve created localized onboarding experiences, fought against fraud, and revolutionized how Uber accepts payments.
tools:
    - Sketch, Framer, After Effects
