overview:
    - As part of the app redesign, I owned global signup and login.
    - From the outset, we knew that our existing funnels were cluttered with information and struggling to meet the needs of new markets as we expanded globally.
    - I proposed that we create a modular platform that would enable customizable funnels by market. This would entail breaking down our existing steps into simple, bite-sized screens that could be easily re-arranged, would decrease the cognitive load on users, and would enable easier experimentation.
    - Armed with a rough Framer prototype, I then went to India and China to validate my hypothesis. The results were great.
    - After returning, we went on to create a rich system that featured visually consistent layouts, buttery animations, and intelligent routing to login or signup based on phone number.
outcome:
    - While I can’t share the exact numbers, there's been a sustained double-digit increase in funnel conversion since we launched the new experience. It was a great success.
    - Multiple teams at Uber have effortlessly plugged into the new signup platform to create localized onboarding experiences, fraud fighting features, and new systems for payment.

![Main signup and login flow](../images/signup/signup-flow-1.png){: .post-image-large}
Flow showing signup from phone number, login from phone number, and login from email. There were a number of tricky edge cases we had to account for like signing up with a recycled phone number or login with a new phone number on an existing account.

A variety of screens from the system. In all, there were around 30 screens created from a base system of 8 reusable layouts.

A prototype of the full signup flow, built in Framer. The signup flow varies in both length and content depending on what makes sense in each market. For example, email isn’t widely used in some developing countries.

Prototypes of interstitial animations and entry point animations. Prototyping was a constant factor throughout our process, both to iterate on our flows and fine-tune the micro-interactions that made our experience feel fluid and magical.
