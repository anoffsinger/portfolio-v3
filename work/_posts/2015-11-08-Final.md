summary: Designing a new age financial app for modern credit card users.
keyColor: final
headerImage: "../images/final/header.mp4"

overview:
    - Final is a new age credit card provider that offers cross-platform finance apps and a physical credit card. The main benefits of the product are world class fraud protection and granular user controls for how merchants can bill accounts.
    - I joined the team when it was a young startup of 5 entering the Techstars accelerator in Boulder, Colorado. The team was yet to release a product and I was their first designer.
    - Over the three months I worked with Final, I helped define the core UX and UI of their first mobile, web, and browser extension apps. We sought to make a radically transparent credit card experience that would be approachable to users with varying levels of financial prowess.
    - We worked with Macky Saturday and Jelly Jar on designing the Final brand and splash page respectively.
outcome:
    - While I was at Final, we amassed 40,000 signups prior to launch. Based on our initial designs (and countless hours spent on pitch decks) we raised $4 million in venture capital.
    - When I left, the team had with a strong design platform and core experience to build on moving into the future.
tools:
    - Sketch, Framer
