summary: Helping build a design platform for latest iteration of the Uber Rider app.

# header

# content
title: Rider App Platform
timing: Shipped November 2016

overview:
    - Part of my work on the new Uber app included a large group of work that can be categorized as platform work.
    - These projects included rethinking the IA of Uber’s side nav and sub-items, designing the Settings and the Edit Account experience, and designing granular system components like inputs and loading indicators.

outcome:
    - This project was less about moving numbers (although clearer IA does increase usability) and more about setting up the new app to better accommodate new features and expansion in general.
    - Since the launch of the app, countless teams have plugged into these frameworks and developed new features.

tools:
    - Sketch, After Effects, Framer

A large part of my work had to do with re organizing and simplifying the IA of the Rider App side nav, which had become cluttered with content over the previous 3 years.

When all was said and done, we went from 10 top level nav items to 5. We removed an unused notification center and About section and streamlined and reorganized our Settings page to prioritize the information riders needed to see most.

Updating Settings also included creating a new Edit Account experience that’s accessible from the top of the Settings page.

The new Edit Account page featured a summary view of personal information that, when tapped, transitions to a focused view of the tapped item that allows for longer flows that require additional screens—like mobile verification when changing phone number.

Last but not least, my platform work also entailed creating reusable components that would help other teams move faster while building new features. Platform work was collaborative during the app redesign and other designers contributed as well.

My contributions included inputs, loading indicators, and toasts of different kinds.
