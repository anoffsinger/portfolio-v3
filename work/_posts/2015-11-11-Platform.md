title: Rider App Platform
shippedDate: Shipped November 2016

overview:
    - Part of my work on the new Uber app included a group of projects that can be categorized as platform design.
    - These projects included rethinking the IA of Uber’s side nav and sub-items, designing the Settings and Edit Account experiences, and designing granular system components like inputs and loading indicators.

outcome:
    - Overall, this project was less about moving numbers (although clearer IA does increase usability) and more about setting up teams across the organization to move faster while creating features in the new app.
    - Since launch, countless teams have plugged into these frameworks and developed new features.

tools:
    - Sketch, After Effects, Framer

One of the largest portions of my work had to do with re-organizing and simplifying the IA of the rider app side nav, which had become cluttered with content over the previous 3 years.

When all was said and done, we went from 10 top level nav items to 5. We removed an unused notification center and About section and streamlined and re-organized our Settings page to prioritize the information riders needed to see most.

Redesigning the Settings page also included creating a new Edit Account experience. Whereas the experience was previously abstracted, it would now be accessible from a simple summary line item at the top of the Settings page.

The new Edit Account page featured a condensed view of the rider's personal information that, when tapped, transitioned to a focused view of the tapped item that allows for longer flows that require additional screens—like mobile verification when changing phone number.

Last but not least, my platform work also entailed creating reusable components that would help other teams move faster while building new features.

My contributions included inputs, loading indicators, and toasts of different kinds. Platform component creation was collaborative during the app redesign and other designers contributed as well.
