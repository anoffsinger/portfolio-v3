title: Rider App Platform
timing: Shipped November 2016

overview:
    - Part of my contribution on the new Uber app included a large group of work that can be categorized as platform work.
    - These projects included rethinking the IA of Uberâ€™s side nav and sub-items, designing the Settings and the Edit Account experience, and designing granular system components like inputs and loading indicators.

outcome:
    - This project was less about moving numbers from a user standpoint (although clearer IA certainly increases usability) and more about setting up the new Rider app to easily accommodate new features and expansion in general.
    - Since the launch of the new app, countless teams have plugged into these frameworks and developed new features.

tools:
    - Lots of sticky notes, Sketch, After Effects, Framer
