title: Rider Platform

overview:
    - Part of my work on the new Uber app included various tasks that could be categorized as Platform work.
    - These projects included rethinking the IA of Uberâ€™s side nav and sub-items, explicitly defining the Settings and the Edit Account experience, and designing granular system components like inputs and loading indicators.

outcome:
    - The outcome of this project was much less about moving numbers from a consumer standpoint (although clearer IA certainly increases usability) and more about setting up the new Rider app to easily accommodate new features and expansion in general.
    - At the same time, granular items like inputs were tested during the redesign and shown to be more usable than our previous components - providing better feedback, labeling, and error experiences.
tools:
    - Lots of sticky notes, Sketch, After Effect, Framer
